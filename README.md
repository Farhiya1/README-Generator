# README Generator

# Why did I build this project?

To create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package in the terminal using node.js. To also build on my javascript skills in a different enviroment.

# So far I have achieved?

1. To generate a read me file through a series of prompts that is to be answered in the terminal.

# What I intend to add in the near future?

1. To continue to build on it with the skills I continue to gain. Ask different questions. Altering structure for different idustries. Use this to eveen generate a readme for my own projects.
